# Time Series Analytics

Master temporal data prediction.

This section focuses on classical and modern time-series methods: ARIMA, state-space models, probabilistic forecasting, and deep sequence models.

Suggested use:
- Start with classical forecasting (ARIMA/ETS)
- Add deep-learning-based time-series resources as a second layer
- Group materials by application (finance, ops, sensors, etc.)
