# Reinforcement Learning

Learn about decision-making algorithms.

This section is for RL theory and practice: MDPs, value-based and policy-based methods, actor-critic, model-based RL, and applications to robotics and games.

Suggested use:
- Start after a solid grounding in probability and deep learning
- Organize resources by level (introductory, intermediate, advanced)
- Tag examples by domain (robotics, games, recommendation, control)
