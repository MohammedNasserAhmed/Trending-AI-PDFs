# NLP & Transformers

Dive into language processing techniques.

This section focuses on natural language processing, embeddings, sequence models, and transformer-based architectures such as BERT, GPT, and T5.

Suggested use:
- Start after you’re comfortable with basic ML
- Compare classic NLP (RNN/CRF) vs. transformer methods
- Collect references for text classification, generation, and retrieval
