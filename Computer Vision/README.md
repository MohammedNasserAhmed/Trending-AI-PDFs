# Computer Vision

Explore image and video analysis methods.

This section covers convolutional networks, detection, segmentation, image generation, and multimodal vision-language models.

Suggested use:
- Start with fundamentals of image processing and CNNs
- Add books and cookbooks on detection, segmentation, and diffusion models
- Group resources by task (classification, detection, generative, multimodal)
